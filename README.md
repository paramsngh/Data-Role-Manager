This Python program and its accompanying test script enable the management of student, instructor,
and teaching assistant information. The main program parses data from a file, filters and retrieves student data based
on their IDs, and writes it to an output file using classes to represent individuals and roles.
The test script demonstrates how to use the main program's features.
